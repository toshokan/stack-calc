# stack-calc
A basic calculator interpreting Reverse Polish Notation

## Usage
Use `./stack-calc -e` to enter "expression mode", where you can type a long sequence of RPN operations to apply all in one line.

Use `./stack-calc` to type keys and operations one at a time and view the registers/stack change as you go like the HP calculators of old.
